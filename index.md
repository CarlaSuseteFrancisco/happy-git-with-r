What is already here:

  * Instructions for Git/GitHub/R/RStudio set-up and early usage.
  * Prompts for workshop activites.

What is coming:

  * More on Git itself, though will mostly rely on rest of the internet for that. I want to add / borrow / link to visual explanations.
  * Workflows and policies for individuals and groups.
    - How often should I commit? Which files should I commit?
    - Data files and the dilemmas they present.
    - Most common Git predicaments. How to avoid and recover.
    - Clone vs fork.
    - Purpose of branches, [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/), [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), tags.
    - Add-as-collaborator vs "fork and pull".
  * Use of the GitHub API for bulk operations.
  * Using GitHub to run a course.
    - Get an Organization.
    - Use of Teams, repos, issues, pushing content into repos.
